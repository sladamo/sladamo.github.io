  <h3>Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take ya!</h3></a>
  <p>
    There's something very special about the Caribbean.
    Frank and I have visited 9 islands there: Cozumel, Grand Cayman, Jamaica, Turks & Caicos, Bahamas, St. Thomas, Antigua, Barbados, Tortola.
    Surprisingly, they are all very different, but have a common tropical theme.
    You can't grow tired of the islands, no matter how hard you try :-).
    We visited all of these islands by cruise. Cruises are such a great way to vacation!

      <h3>Carnival Cruise 2014 - Turks & Caicos and the Bahamas</h3>
      <p>
        In May 2014, we took our third cruise together, to celebrate our 1-year wedding anniversary.
        We became scuba certified on this trip, since we love diving, and wanted to go deeper than ever before.
        We dove <a class="btn btn-primary btn-xs"href="http://www.carnival.com/shore-excursions/grand-turk/certified-scuba-440006#"target="_blank"role="button">"The Wall" in Turks & Caicos</a>, an exhilerating, world-renowned dive feautring a wall of coral that drops down 7,000 feet.
        Fortunately, we only dove to 90 feet, which was plenty of excitement for us!
        We saw nurse sharks, sea turtles, baracudas, and plenty of colorful fish and coral.<br/>

      <h3>Princess Cruise 2012 - St. Thomas, Barbados, Antigua, Tortola</h3>
      <p>
        In January 2012, we took our second cruise together, which Frank's family.
        We dove in St. Thomas, and did a beach day in Antigua.
        My favorite memory from this cruise was swinging from a rope off of a pirate ship into the ocean in Barbados.
        It was a <a class="btn btn-primary btn-xs" href="http://www.funbarbados.com/tours/jollyroger.cfm"target="_blank" role="button">Jolly Roger 1 tour</a></p><br/>
        Here is a quick video of some friendly rooster chicks on Tortola.

      <h3>Hawaii - Our Honeymoon on Maui and Kauai</h3>
      <p>
        We had both never been to Hawaii before, so it was an easy choice when deciding where to Honeymoon.
        Two days after our wedding in May 2013, we departed for 2 weeks on Maui and Kauai.
        We did more adventure activity on Maui, and more relaxation on Kauai, which was a perfect balance for a perfect trip.
        It is a very special place, and Chicago could use some serious Aloha!

                It was the last night of our Honeymoon before heading back to Chicago.
                After all this beauty, we sure could have used one more day!</li></ul>

      <h3>What's next?</h3>
      <p>
        Our next stop? We hope to visit Portland, Maine in Fall 2016!
        We have recenly become curious about this mysterious state, and exploring nature there.
        Perhaps we'll go white water rafting too!<br/>
