  <h3>Ciao! Guten Tag! Zdravo!</h3></a>
  <p>
    I have visited Europe twice, and seen 3 countries: Italy, Germany and Croatia!
    I truly enjoyed all 3 countries; it is hard to pick a favorite.
    They are all special for different reasons.
    I visited Italy in Winter 2008 and Germany/Croatia in Summer 2012.

      <h3>Dubrovnik, Croatia</h3>
      <p>
        In Summer 2012, I traveled to Europe for the second time to visit my friend Ramina who was living in Berlin at the time.
        During my visit, we took a 5-day trip to <a class="btn btn-primary btn-xs"href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Dubrovnik"target="_blank"role="button">Dubrovnik, Croatia</a>, a city that Ramina always wanted to visit, so I agreed to tag along.
        And I'm so glad that I did. What a gorgeous city! We rented a little apartment against the hillside, and took a 30 minute walk downtown everyday.
        We didn't mind because it was brutally hot that July and we needed 2-double scoop gelatos a day in order to stay cool.</p>

        <p>The highlight of Croatia was cliff diving on the beautiful island of Lokrum. Here is a video showing just how crazy I was!

      <h3>Carnival Cruise - Turks & Caicos and the Bahamas</h3>
      <p>
        Frank and I love cruising! In May 2014, we took our third cruise together, to celebrate our 1-year wedding anniversary.
        We became scuba certified on this trip, since we love diving, and wanted to go deeper than ever before.
        We dove <a class="btn btn-primary btn-xs"href="http://www.carnival.com/shore-excursions/grand-turk/certified-scuba-440006#"target="_blank"role="button">"The Wall" in Turks & Caicos</a>, an exhilerating, world-renowned dive feautring a wall of coral that drops down 7,000 feet.
        Fortunately, we only dove to 90 feet, which was plenty of excitement for us!
        We saw nurse sharks, sea turtles, baracudas, and plenty of colorful fish and coral.<br/>

      <h3>Hawaii - Our Honeymoon on Maui and Kauai</h3>
      <p>
        We had both never been to Hawaii before, so it was an easy choice when deciding where to Honeymoon.
        Two days after our wedding in May 2013, we departed for 2 weeks on Maui and Kauai.
        We did more adventure activity on Maui, and more relaxation on Kauai, which was a perfect balance for a perfect trip.
        It is a very special place, and Chicago could use some serious Aloha!

                It was so perfect!
                I will never forget it.</li></ul><br/>

                It was the last night of our Honeymoon before heading back to Chicago.
                After all this beauty, we sure could have used one more day!</li></ul>

      <h3>What's next?</h3>
      <p>
        Our next stop? We hope to visit Portland, Maine in Fall 2016!
        We have recenly become curious about this mysterious state, and exploring nature there.
        Perhaps we'll go white water rafting too!<br/>
