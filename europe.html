  <h3>Guten Tag! Zdravo! Ciao!</h3></a>
  <p>
    I have visited Europe twice, and seen 3 countries: Italy, Croatia, and Germany!
    I truly enjoyed all 3 countries; it is hard to pick a favorite.
    They are all special for different reasons.
    I visited Italy in Winter 2008 and Germany/Croatia in Summer 2012.

      <h3>Berlin, Germany</h3>
      <p>
        In Summer 2012, I traveled to Europe for the second time to visit my friend Ramina who was living in Berlin at the time.
        Germany is such a cool country and <a class="btn btn-primary btn-xs"href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g187323-Activities-Berlin.html"target="_blank"role="button">Berlin</a>  was a very exciting city.
        We visited plenty of World War II memorials, including Hitler's bunker! Seeing the Berlin Wall was a real treat.
        Overall, I was very impressed with the German people, particularly their discipline, hard-working nature, and good-heartedness.</p>

        <p>Germany's Biergartens are not to be missed! There, I enjoyed many ice cold Berliners among the tranquil scenery.

      <h3>Dubrovnik, Croatia</h3>
      <p>
        While visiting Ramina in Berlin, we took a 5-day trip to <a class="btn btn-primary btn-xs"href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Dubrovnik"target="_blank"role="button">Dubrovnik, Croatia</a>, a city that Ramina had always wanted to visit, so I agreed to tag along.
        And boy am I glad that I did. What a gorgeous city; easily one of my favorites in the whole world!
        We rented a little apartment against the hillside, and took a 30 minute walk downtown (downhill) and back (uphill) everyday.
        We didn't mind because it was brutally hot that July, and we needed 2 double scoop gelatos per day in order to stay cool. Come on...it was a matter of survival!</p>

        <p>The highlight of Croatia was cliff diving on the beautiful island of Lokrum. Here is a video showing just how crazy we were!

      <h3>10 Cities in 10 Days: An Italian Voyage</h3>
      <p>During my junior year of college, my 2 close high school friends and I visited Italy through a college-student organized tour.
        The itinerary said we'd visit 10 cities in 10 days, and that we did. In chronological order, we saw: Milan, Verona, Venice, Florence, Sienna, Assisi, Pompei, Sorrento, the Vatican, and Rome!
        What a nutty schedule it was, but it was so awesome to see the entire country in such a short and convenient way.
        My family roots are from Italy, so this was a very special trip for me.
        We spent New Year's in Florence near the <a class="btn btn-primary btn-xs"href="http://www.visitflorence.com/florence-monuments/piazzale-michelangelo.html"target="_blank"role="button">Michaelangelo statue</a>, carrying a bottle of champagne in the streets along with thousands of others.
        It was awesome! I wasn't even 21 yet! But it was perfectly legal in Italy.</p>

        <p>Here is one of my favorite memories in Rome: throwing a penny into the ancient Trevi fountain.
